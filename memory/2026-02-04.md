## Today's Activities

### Work Tracker Implementation
- Status: Completed
- Time: 22:35 -> 22:40
- Result: Created WORK_TRACKER.md with template for tracking work results
- Changes: Updated AGENTS.md to include work tracking guidelines

### GitHub Discussion Request
- Status: Failed
- Time: 22:29 -> 22:31
- Result: GH CLI doesn't support discussion command
- Reason: Current GH CLI version lacks discussion functionality

### Surfpool Installation
- Status: Failed
- Time: Around 22:24
- Result: Surfpool installation failed due to missing Rust dependency

## Notes
- Need to implement proper work result tracking as requested
- Current system now includes template for recording success/failure reasons
- GitHub CLI limitation identified for future reference
