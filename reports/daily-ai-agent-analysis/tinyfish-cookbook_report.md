## About This Repository

Welcome to the **TinyFish Cookbook!** This is a growing collection of recipes, demos, and automations built with TinyFish.

Think of this like a recipe book for the web. Whether you want to build an automated travel agent, a job application bot, or a market research tool, you can grab a recipe here, tweak the ingredients, and start cooking.

## What is TinyFish?

TinyFish is a **web agents API** that lets you treat real websites like programmable surfaces. Instead of juggling headless browsers, selectors, proxies, and weird edge cases, you call a single API with a goal and some URLs and get back clean JSON. It handles navigation, forms, filters, dynamic content, and multi-step flows across many sites at once, so you can focus on product logic instead of browser plumbing.

The same enterprise-grade infrastructure used in large production environments is now exposed directly to developers.

## Power Features in one API

- **Any website as an API** — Turn ordinary websites (including ones without official APIs) into programmable surfaces for your apps.
- **Natural language -> structured JSON** — Send a URL (or many) plus a natural language goal, get back clean JSON in the shape you specify.
- **Real browser automation** — Navigate real websites in real time. We handle complex flows like multi-step bookings, form filling, filters, calendars, and dynamic JavaScript content.
- **Built-in Stealth** — Every request runs in a stealth browser profile with rotating proxies to reduce the chance of triggering anti-bot defenses. (No extra charge for proxy data).
- **Production-grade Logs** — Every run comes with detailed observability so you can debug, monitor, and actually trust what the agents did.
- **Flexible Integration** — Use it as a direct HTTP API, through our visual Playground, or as an MCP server inside tools like Claude and Cursor.
